## Internet
Q1) Jab mobile wire se connected nahi hai to message America ja kaise raha hai??
- Mobile se ek rays nikalti hai and wo nearest tower tak jati hai,
data moble form se bahar niklega in the tform of small packets
- and iss data ki itni kshamta nahi hoti hai ki ye kayi kilaometer tak ja chali jaye.

- Agar aap isi kai kilometer tak leke jaoge
to iski intensityh dhimi ho jati hai and data me aa jate hai errors.

- Tower recieved data in the from of packets 
- then it converts it to electrical signal
- then it gets tranferred through the wire (Optical Fibre)inside the ground from India via Ocean route to America.
- In America the nearest Tower tho the person which is the reciever gets the electrical signal
- then the Tower converts the electrical signal in form of packets, and sends it to the Receiver's device
- then the receiver recieves the message

## http | https
hyper text transfer protocol (http)
hyper text transfer protocol secure (https)

- http /https protocol ke bina tum na internet pe kuchh bhej sakte ho na kuchh manga sakte ho

- inka kaam hai data ko bhejna aur receive karwana

- jinhone internet ko banaya unhone kuchh set of rules banaya

- jitne bhi internet service providers hai wo sab inn rules ko follow karna padega
-  ye hamare haath me nahi hai ki hum rules follow na kare

- in http site 
- we can set extra dongle in another device and turn on the monitor mode,
Now I can check and see the message in the other device
- this is dangerous

https  - we cannot read that message bcz thiat message is encrypted

- kisi bhi server se connect hone keliye ports hote hai
- ports gate through which we can enter the server

- open ports | closed ports
- if some body is connected to that port, to hum uss port ko use nahi kar sakte
- random numbers like 3000, 1234
- wo no. hum apne mann se rakh sakte hai.
